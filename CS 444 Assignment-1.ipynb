    "Next, you will train a Softmax classifier. This classifier consists of a linear function of the input data followed by a softmax function which outputs a vector of dimension C (number of classes) for each data point. Each entry of the softmax output vector corresponds to a confidence in one of the C classes, and like a probability distribution, the entries of the output vector sum to 1. We use a cross-entropy loss on this sotmax output to train the model. \n",
